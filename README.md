# 🧠 Git & GitHub Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal **Git & GitHub learning playground**! This repository was created to help me deepen my understanding of version control using Git and explore the collaborative features offered by GitHub.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

This repo includes hands-on practice with:

- ✅ Essential Git commands (`init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, etc.)
- 🌿 Branching strategies and merge techniques
- ⚔️ Conflict resolution exercises
- 🔧 Exploring GitHub tools (Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, etc.)
- 🧪 Experiments, trials, and a few mistakes along the way (that’s how we learn!)

## 🎯 Purpose

This space is all about **practice and improvement**. I’ll be using it to:

- Sharpen my command-line skills  
- Understand Git internals better  
- Simulate real-world workflows  
- Make peace with merge conflicts 😅

## 🚀 Let’s Go!

Feel free to explore — but remember, this repo is all about learning in progress. Mistakes are welcome, experiments are encouraged, and improvement is the goal!
